Here are my notes during solution & problem simplification.<br/>

each order has: (time to cook per side, time to picked up)<br/>
cooks can do two actions per second, and each action takes one second<br/>
* place a new patty on the grill,
* flip a patty that is already on the grill,
* remove a patty from the grill to serve it to a customer, or
* do nothing.

How many chefs are required?<br/>
=> What is the maximum number of actions per second<br/>
=> Max actions / 2 (since chef can do two actions at once)
